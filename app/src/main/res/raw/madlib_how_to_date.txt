It's simple. Turn the <plural-noun>. Make him/her <adverb> want to date you. Make sure you're always dressed to <verb>. Each and every day, do something that you know shows off your <adjective> <body-part>, and make your <noun> look like a million <plural-noun>. Even if the two of you make meaninful <body-part> contact, don't admit it. No hugs or <plural-noun>. Just shake her/his <body-part> firmly. And remember, when he/she finally asks you out, play it <adjective>. Take a long pause before answering in a very <adjective> voice: "I'll have to <verb> it over."
