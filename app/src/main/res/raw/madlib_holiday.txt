I was <ing-verb> at the <place> the other day when I heard <holiday-song> come on the radio. I was feeling really <adjective> and I’m pretty sure I looked super <adjective> because <person> walked in and almost <past-tense-verb>. This time every year I <verb> all the time because I get really exciting thinking about holiday <plural-noun>! That’s why I was sitting at the <place>: I was really hoping <person> would come by and give me at least <number> piece(s) of holiday <food>! That didn’t happen, but suddenly <person> <past-tense-verb> by in a huge <noun> on wheels dressed up as <celebrity>. I know <adjective> things happen around the holidays, but this didn’t make any sense! I picked up the phone to call <person>, but the phone turned into a big pile of <food> and dripped all the way down to my <body-part>! Then my alarm clock went off! It was all a dream! I had a ton of <food> before I went to sleep. Maybe that’s what gave me the crazy dream!
